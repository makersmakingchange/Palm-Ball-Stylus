# Palm Ball Stylus
The Palm Ball Stylus is intended for users who cannot use traditional stylus pens for a variety of reasons. Instead of a traditional pen style stylus, it ends in a large ball that requires much less strength and dexterity to grip. The device uses a length of wire and conductive foam to allow the user to interact with the capacitive touchscreen.
